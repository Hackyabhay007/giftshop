        Our return policy lasts for 30 days from the date of purchase. Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds or exchanges after this period. To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in the same condition as when you received it, and in its original packaging. Please note that certain items, such as personalized products (e.g., custom engravings, monogrammed items), gift cards, and perishable gifts, are non-returnable. To process your return, you must provide a receipt or proof of purchase. Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer. In some cases, partial refunds may be granted, such as for items that are not in their original condition, are damaged, or missing parts due to reasons not caused by us, or for items returned more than 30 days after delivery.
